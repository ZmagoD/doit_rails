        fantastic opportunity to gain experience in all aspects of the retail operation.
        Our Stock Room Volunteers are trained to assist in a wide range of activities
        including: \r\n\r\nLooking through our donations to select and sort the quality
        stock for the shop floor. \r\nSorting and organising stock in the stockroom
        so that the area is kept in order. \r\nWorking behind the scenes to help to
        hang, size, steam and price stock. \r\nMaking sure all stock is safe and in
        working order.\r\n\r\nWe will provide you with all the support you need to
        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store
        manager and the rest of the team. Volunteering in a Barnardo''s charity shop
        allows you to gain new skills and meet new people whilst making a big difference

        "JOIN IN, FEEL GOOD!\n\nWest Hampstead Green Gym is looking for volunteers
        who want to improve their health and well-being by creating a better environment
        at three lovely sites in West Hampstead. Come along for as long as you like,
        enjoy the outdoors and work at your own pace and ability!\n\nGreen Gyms are
        fun and free outdoor sessions where you will be guided in practical conservation
        activities such as planting trees, sowing meadows and cultivating crops, establishing
        wildlife ponds, coppicing and weeding invasive plants, as well as building
        wildlife habitats.\n\nThe Green Gym\u00ae is a successful nationwide initiative
        by The Conservation Volunteers, set up as a unique way to get fit, transform
        the environment, meet new people and learn new skills. Each session starts
        with a warm up and finishes with a cool down before and after a range of light
        to vigorous activities, designed to suit different abilities.\n\nFor more
        information contact Giles Green on tel 07900678991 email gg-westhampstead@tcv.org.uk
        web www.tcv.org.uk/camden\n\nThrough local collective action The Conservation
        Volunteers support over 300''000 volunteers through practical and environmental
        conservation projects each year. \n\nTCV is a registered charity number 261009",

        "Become an instrumental part of an innovative project tackling mental ill-health
        issues within the Bengali, Black, and Irish communities of Camden. \n\nThe
        Role Involves:\n\n- Putting people first and connecting with them on their
        terms, wherever they feel most comfortable: clubs or cafes, mosques or churches,
        college or university, at home or on the go \n\n- Identifying relevant people
        and places in order to run tailored \u201cmutual learning sessions\u201d (these
        informal meet-ups will allow each community to come up with their own original
        ideas for raising mental health awareness and reducing stigma.) \n\n- Harnessing
        this energy and insight, you\u2019ll then go on to co-produce (together) the
        most popular and exciting ideas.\n\nThe Role is Flexible:\n\n- You can be
        involved in a big way: meeting with lots of people, helping to surface many
        ideas and then helping to see them through. \n\n- Or, you may prefer to engage
        with just one or two groups of people: perhaps you are well situated to meet
        up with your local barber shop, pub, or youth club, where you\u2019re confident
        you can get people talking and creating ideas.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name":

        for a Bangali speaking volunteer to visit an socially isolated older lady
        once weekly for social visits.  The opportunity to speak to someone in Bengali
        will be greatly valued by her. She is also a keen gardener and would really
        benefit support from a volunteer to access the garden area. \n\nWe currently
        have about 40 volunteers who are visiting older people (60plus) at home. The
        older people who use our befriending scheme are often physically less able,
        often quite isolated and lonely because of this. Most volunteers visit once
        a week, some fortnightly. The relationships are all personalised to the individuals
        involved. Some volunteers go round and have a chat; some do creative activities
        together, we have had people do basketry, photography, painting, make cakes,
        jewellery, bunting; and some people offer more practical help i.e. wheelchair
        assisting, escorting to appointments, or providing support at our weekly sandwich
        club.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": "Laura and Emma", "created": "2014-10-28T08:58:56.492780+00:00",

        and come together in the usual way of a partnership at appropriate times.  By
        volunteering for two organizations, the experience you gain and qualifications
        you earn would be beneficially varied. \n\nChoosing to serve one organization
        and not the other would also be appropriate.\n   \nThe tasks would involve
        raising funds mainly by on-line application to funders, and ensuring each
        organization fulfils the conditions of funding applications, by way of assembling
        documents  funders require. These documents would include the organizations''
        constitutions, business plans, and proof of demand for the organizations''
        service.\n\nTo carry out these tasks, the volunteer would join the management
        committee, and confer with fellow members about the running of the organizations.\n\nThe
        volunteer would  gain experience, to be recorded on his or her CV,  to benefit  his
        or her prospects for paid employment.\n\nTraining sessions with Speak Up would
        widen your knowledge of the volunteer sector and the specialist skills required
        for fundraising.\n\nYou will be able to network with other organizations and
        discuss your ambitions with others for mutual benefit.\n\nThe opportunity
        would be there, if you wish, to develop your leadership skills in your field,
        or in other fields in volunteering.\n\nWhen not attending meetings and events  at
        Swiss Cottage Library, London NW3, you would work from your own home.", "for_recruiter":

        "If you can spare a few hours most weekends, you could be the person who brightens
        the childhood and improves the life chances of a disadvantaged child or young
        person.\n  \nWe match children in need of support with a volunteer friendship
        mentor who meets with them for two to three hours at the weekend on a long-term
        basis. \n\nTogether, our friendships plan regular, local outings that give
        a young person access to the everyday childhood experiences that most young
        people would take for granted. These outings give mentors an opportunity to
        build a safe, supportive friendship with their mentee, through which they
        can offer emotional support and help a young person develop valuable life
        skills.\n\nA friendship mentor is someone who has positive perspectives, life-experiences
        and skills to share with a child or young person. They listen and help a child
        to understand themselves and find their own solutions in life. They help a
        child to explore the world around them and their own potential for the present
        and the future. They bring stability, consistency, security and reliability
        to a child\u2019s life, helping to build their confidence and develop new
        life-skills. \n\nFor many children, they are the only adult outside of the
        family who spends time with them not because they are mandated or paid to
        be there, but simply because they want to be.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name":

        suited to people living in or on the boundaries of the Borough of Camden.\n\nThe
        aim of the Dementia Adviser Service is to help improve the lives of people
        affected by dementia. It does this by providing tailored, quality information
        about local and national services to people with a diagnosis of dementia (or
        who experience memory problems and may have dementia) and their carers, and
        to enable them to access these. \n\nDementia Adviser Volunteers assist the
        Dementia Adviser Service Co-ordinator in supporting people affected by throughout
        their journey with dementia.\n\nThis is not a Befriending Role:  You may only
        see a client once or twice in the course of your role.\n\nVolunteer Role:
        \nBe an additional named contact in the Dementia Adviser service.\nSupport
        people who have a diagnosis of dementia, or who are in the process of diagnosis,
        as well others who are close to them.\nMeet people, at home if needed, to
        support them in finding and in understanding information\nMeet people, at
        home if needed, to support them in finding and using relevant services\n\nThis
        would be good experience for anyone interested in gaining experience of engaging
        with people with dementia and older people, learning about services and how
        they operate and impact on the quality of life of older people. \nAll volunteers
        attend an induction to the organisation and receive training on Dementia Awareness.\nOnce
        volunteering with the organisation volunteers can avail of in-house training
        opportunities.\n\nAny travel and other out of pocket expenses will be paid
        for the days you volunteer.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": "Geraldine

        have some loss of both their sight and hearing and can become very lonely,
        socially isolated and often without regular contact with their family or friends.
        Many are unable to continue with the hobbies and social activities they have
        enjoyed in the past. Why not join our team and become a befriender to help
        reduce their isolation and improve their wellbeing? The majority of our members
        who are looking for a Befriender use speech to communicate, however, if you
        have sign language and would like to use this skill we could look to match
        you with a person who needs this communication support. You would start by
        meeting the person in their home to get to know them, then you would go out
        and about with the person for a local walk, visit a cafe, museum, or local
        attraction; the options are endless. Part of this role would be to help the
        person build and maintain social interaction and independence by at times
        taking part in activities in their local community thus helping to break their
        sense of isolation and improve their quality of life. This role is very flexible;
        you could meet as much as once a week for 2-3 hours, fortnightly or even monthly.
        What''s important is that it takes time to build relationships and so a commitment
        of at least 3 months is required. We will try and match you with someone who
        shares common interests with you to help you build a meaningful relationship
        also for you to meet at a time of each other''s convenience, which could be
        during the day time, in an evening, during weekdays or at weekends. This role
        is suitable for anyone over 18 yrs. Old.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name":

        "People who are Deafblind have some loss of both their sight and hearing and
        can become very lonely, socially isolated and often without regular contact
        with their family or friends. Many are unable to continue with the hobbies
        and social activities they have enjoyed in the past. Why not join our team
        and become a volunteer at our social group to help reduce their isolation
        and improve their wellbeing? \nThe majority of our members at this group use
        speech to communicate, however, if you have sign language and would like to
        use this skill we could possibly look to match you with a person who needs
        this communication support. You would start by coming to a group session to
        see if you would enjoy being a volunteer with us, and then we would complete
        the necessary training with you.\nThe group meet monthly for a couple of hours  and
        enjoy crafts, games, guest speakers or entertainers, but most of all a good
        old natter.  If you have the time to spare to help out, are good at engaging
        people in conversation then please get in touch today!\nIf you have a driving
        license and vehicle and would be happy to transport a member to and from the
        group too then that would be brilliant. \nThis role is suitable for anyone
        over 18 yrs. Old.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": null, "created": "2014-10-27T18:16:46.095154+00:00",

        to help support our busy Older People''s Project, particularly during weekday
        daytimes. \n\nThis would include helping on outings to some beautiful and
        exciting destinations around the south of England; supporting activities and
        workshops in the community centre; helping out on trips locally; and escorting
        some of our older members to appointments, offering both practical and moral
        support. \n\nWe are hoping to find volunteers who can share in a conversation
        bringing with them a feeling of warmth and friendliness; and people who can
        offer practical help escorting older people to come on trips and get out and
        about using wheelchairs. \n\nBeing a volunteer with us at St. Pancras Community
        Association means you will become part of a diverse community of people; an
        extended family with many different stories to tell, and lots going on to
        get involved in. You will become part of an established and growing team of
        volunteers and will be invited along to regular volunteer gatherings to celebrate
        and share this. We offer volunteer expenses so you will not be out of pocket.
        We also offer access to a range of different training courses to develop your
        skills needed to volunteer, and to pursue your own interests. Staff will be
        there to offer you support and guidance in your placement, and to listen to
        the new ideas and perspectives that you can bring to us. Once you have become
        settled into your placement with us, we will also be able to provide you with
        a reference for any applications you may be making. \n\nAs a volunteer with
        us, you will receive an initial Induction session, which is an opportunity
        to get to know other volunteers starting alongside you, to get a detailed
        impression of the role you will be taking on, and the issues surrounding it.
        During your time with us a whole host of training courses will be available
        to you.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": "Laura and Emma", "created": "2014-10-28T08:58:56.492780+00:00",

        by The Conservation Volunteers, set up as a unique way to get fit, transform
        the environment, meet new people and learn new skills. Each session starts
        with a warm up and finishes with a cool down before and after a range of light
        to vigorous activities, designed to suit different abilities.\n\nFor more
